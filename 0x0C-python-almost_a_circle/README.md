# 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle

This repository contains Python programs and models developed for the ALX High Level Programming curriculum, focusing on building a solid understanding of Python concepts and object-oriented programming. The main goal is to implement a set of classes that represent geometric shapes, with a primary focus on rectangles and squares.

## Running the Drawing Function

To visualize the geometric shapes, you can use the `main.py` script. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the drawing function, showcasing the rectangles and squares created within the provided examples.

## Example Output
